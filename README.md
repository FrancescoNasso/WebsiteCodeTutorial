# WebsiteCodeTutorial

<p>Making a website to help me digest code/syntax as I learn new things. I will continue adding to this page as I learn new coding language and formating styles.</p> 
<p>I hope to add to this page atleast once a day.</p>

<h3>Developer's Blog</h3>
<h5>October 12th</h5>
<p>This is the first of a daily blog where I keep track of my progress coding on this website. Today I added info on creating superscripts and subscripts. I also changed the title of the page, and made some edits to the CSS file to disply borders around the div.</p>
<p>PS: I'm actually testing to see if I can update a github readme file straight from brackets.</p>
