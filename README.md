# WebsiteCodeTutorial

<p>I developed this website as an outlet for building with my self-guided lessons in code. A secondary goal for this website is to share this site with my relatives, friends, and anyone else who is also interested in learning code. I will continue adding to this page as my knowledge of coding increases. <em>My aspirational goal is to contribute to this website atleast once per day.</em></p>
