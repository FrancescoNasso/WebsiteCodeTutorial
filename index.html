        <p>You can use the <b>&lt;p&gt;</b> tag in order to write paragraphs. Paragraphs have a default styling which you can further customize using CSS.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>You can use heading tag <b>&lt;h1&gt;</b> - <b>&lt;h6&gt;</b> to designate headings. Browsers attribute their own size and font to each heading.</p>
		<h1>Heading 1</h1>
		<h2>Heading 2</h2>
		<h3>Heading 3</h3>
		<h4>Heading 4</h4>
		<h5>Heading 5</h5>
		<h6>Heading 6</h6>	
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>You can make things <b>bold</b> with the <b>&lt;b&gt;</b> tag. Alternatively, you can use the <b>&lt;strong&gt;</b> tag to denote exactly the same thing.</p> 
	</div>
    <div>
        <p>You can make your content italicized using <i>&lt;i&gt;</i>. The same effect can be achieved using <em>&lt;i&gt;</em> which stands for emphasis.</p>
    </div>
	<div>
		<p>You can use HTML to denote superscript (e.g., 1<sup>2</sup>) using the &lt;<b>sup</b>&gt; tag. You can also use subscript (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>0) by using the &lt;<b>sub</b>&gt; tag. </p>
	</div>
    <div>
        <p>Line breaks <b>&lt;br /&gt;</b> are really good for making things appear on new lines. <br/>
            Just
        <br/>
            Like
        <br/> 
            This
        </p>
        <p>Horizontal breaks <b>&lt;hr /&gt;</b> like the one above are great for splitting content.</p>
        <p><strong>Fun Fact</strong>: You don't need closing or opening tags for either of these breaks. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Blockquotes <b>&lt;blockquotes&gt;</b> are used to specify longer quotes. When combined with CSS you can use it to apply a specific stylization to your larger quotes.</p>
            <blockquote>"It was the best of times it was the worst of times." - The opening to A Tale of Two Cities.</blockquote>
            You can also specify smaller quotes using the quote attribute <quote>For smaller quotes use this!</quote>
        <p><b>Fun Fact</b>: You will rarely use this...</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>You can use abbreviations to provide a full word when its abreviated.</p>
        <p>For example...<abbr title="Water, Hydrogen dioxide">H<sub>2</sub>0</abbr></p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>You can also use HTML for citations. For example, take a look at the following quotation.</p>
        <blockquote>“Maybe there aren't any such things as good friends or bad friends - maybe there are just friends, people who stand by you when you're hurt and who help you feel not so lonely. Maybe they're always worth being scared for, and hoping for, and living for. Maybe worth dying for too, if that's what has to be. No good friends. No bad friends. Only people you want, need to be with; people who build their houses in your heart.”</blockquote>

        <p>Definition tags can be used to specfy a definition.
